# KeyValueStore

Concurrent Key-Value store with Web API

## Footnote

This is a simplified version.

- Minimal API instead of controller-based API
- Removed interfaces, the problem is too simple to even think about IoC/DI stuff
- Removed tests, this is CRUD not point in testing a CRUD API
- Less code, easy to read, everything is straight forward
